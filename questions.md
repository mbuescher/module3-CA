#Main Question:
* Why all the work with the Terminal version of git?

* It seems like we're going back two generations to when only the select few could
use technology and small typos caused enormous errors.  The vast majority of my
students have never in their lives used a command line, and most probably never will.
My students will be using GitHub and will use the BlueJ interface.  Our robotics
team uses GitHub and the eclipse interface.  They are very happy with it.

*So why is the Campus Advisor path so heavily command-line based?
